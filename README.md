# ansible.yaml

## What is Ansible?
- Ansible is a powerful open-source automation tool used to configure, manage, and deploy software across multiple servers or devices. It’s widely used in DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and IT operations

## How does this work?
- You write a playbook (YAML file) describing what you want to do, e.g., install Nginx, configure a firewall, or check SELinux compliance
- Ansible connects to each server via SSH (Linux) and executes tasks
